      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught web developer and programmer with a two and a half year background in studying Mechatronic Engineering at North West University. During the two and a half years that I spent at University, I was taught the basics of programming in C. I applied these skills in various projects, assignments and tests in my engineering modules.<br>
        <br>
        These projects consisted of simple C functions, lookup lists, file management, sorting methods and more complex things like building a button control circuitboard with an lcd display. However during the last 2-3 months I have been learning about web design, teaching myself, as well as learning by lead of a mentor, how to code in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Please feel free to check out my projects that I have completed in the last 2-3 months.
