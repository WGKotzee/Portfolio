      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a self-taught web developer and programmer with a background in Mechatronic Engineering at North West University.<br>
        During the two and a half years that I spent at University, I was taught the basics of programming in C.<br>
        I applied these skills in various projects, assignments and tests in my engineering modules. These projects consisted of simple C functions, lookup lists, file management, sorting methods and more complex things like building a button control circuitboard with an lcd display. However during the last 2-3 months I have<br>
        been learning about web design, teaching myself, as well as learning by lead of a mentor, how to code in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
